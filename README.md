Project Title: To-Do App â€“ Java Swing (MVC + SRP)
This is a simple To-Do List Application developed in Java using Swing with a focus on the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture and Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) from SOLID principles. The app allows users to:

 Add tasks with title and description
